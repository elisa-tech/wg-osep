# Welcome to OSEP

This is the home of the **Open Source Engineering Process (OSEP)** working
group, part of the Linux Foundation's [ELISA](https://elisa.tech/) project

This working group examines how software engineering processes can be used to
facilitate the certification of safety-related systems incorporating Linux and
other FOSS. We consider the roles that a Linux-based OS might have in such
systems; how FOSS developers, system integrators and product creators can
specify these roles; and the evidence they might need to provide to support
associated safety arguments.
