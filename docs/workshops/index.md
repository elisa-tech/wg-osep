as it applies also to other material."

When content is contributed and added to the knowledge base, the following aspects should be considered.

- Technical review of presentations to check for factual inaccuracies
- Check that links included in the presentations are still accessible
- Identify any other serious issues with the presentation content

As there can be a delay in uploading content to the knowledge base, the following aspect
should be considered if material is not uploaded in a timely manner after actual presentation.

- Check with the author if they would like to make changes to address
   any issues we find



Note: So far this is just a drafting idea under discussion and not enforced.
