## Revisiting criteria

[//]: # "We should put this section into another more formal place, 
as it applies also to other material."

When content gets contributed and added to the knowledge base following aspects should be considered.

- Technical review of presentations to check for factual inaccuracies
- Check that links included in the presentations are still accessible
- Identify any other serious issues with the presentation content

As there can be a delay in uploading content to the knowledge base, the following aspect
should be considered if material is not uploaded in a timely manner after actual presentation.

- Check with the author if they would like to make changes to address
   any issues we find



Note: So far this is just a drafting idea under discussion and not enforced. 
It should basically help as a guidance. In case you spot anything in the material 
which need to be commented or updated, please raise an GitHub issue or PR.
