These can be called \u2018benchmark\u2019 and \u2018target\u2019 in the specification. Qualify \u2018Target\u2019 must specify \u2018when\u2019 a performance level is available. Other qualifiers such as \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018if\u2019 should be explicit if not elsewhere specified. Complete A complete document is clear without further elaboration because it sufficiently describes the capability and characteristics it is intended to cover. Correct A document is correct when it is either free from error or it is accurate. Consistent A document is consistent if it contains no contradictions. Verifiable A document is verifiable if it is possible to demonstrate that all assertions in the document can be reproduced. There are no unsupported hypotheses in the document. The assertions can be verified by either demonstration, observation or review. Claims or hypotheses must be backed by references to the associated source code or published documentation (ideally in the public domain), with specific, reproducible tests to demonstrate or confirm the claim. Reproducible Reproducibility is specifically about what a document is referencing.  When a document describes a project sufficiently that it can be recreated, the document is considered reproducible. Compliant A document is compliant when it is being used to satisfy a standard.  The standard can be from a public source, such as IEC or ISO, or it can be a regulation as from a government, such as FMVSS. Maintainable A document is maintainable when it can be modified or extended, e.g. by the introduction of new versions or by adding/removing sections. Grammatical A document is grammatical when it is well formed.  The document is in accordance with the productive rules of the grammar of a language.  Because there is variation in what is expected, the grammatical rules followed for a given document should be specified before the document is created. For example, a requirements document could be specified to conform to the syntactic rules of EARS (Easy Approach to Requirement Syntax.)"},{"location":"Criteria-Documentation-Evaluation.html#file-metadata","title":"File metadata","text":"Metadata Explanation Major Version X(.0) Minor Version Example: X(.1 to .6) \u2013 Minor version can be an indicator of the maturity of the version X.1 \u2013 Initial version \ud83e\udc6a Send for peer review X.2 \u2013 Peer review feedback received \ud83e\udc6a Mark as X.2, incorporate feedback X.3 \u2013 Feedback incorporated \ud83e\udc6a Mark as X.3, send for expert review X.4 \u2013 Expert feedback received \ud83e\udc6a Mark as X.4, incorporate feedback X.5 \u2013 Feedback incorporated \ud83e\udc6a Mark as X.5, send for acceptance review X.6 \u2013 Acceptance review received \ud83e\udc6a Mark as X.6, incorporate feedback (X+1).0 \u2013 Feedback incorporated \ud83e\udc6a Mark as next Major version (.0), release ID UUID Status (See below)"},{"location":"Criteria-Documentation-Evaluation.html#status-example-only","title":"Status (Example only)","text":"Status Proposed In Progress Under Review Verified Released"},{"location":"Criteria-Documentation-Evaluation.html#file-header-metadata-example-only","title":"File header metadata (Example only)","text":"Metadata Explanation Title Title of the document Author Author of the document.

Not a problem with the document. Question Could be considered as a minor also.  This is a question from the reviewer to the author to elaborate or clarify something that is unclear.
