We consider the roles that a Linux-based OS might have in such systems; how FOSS developers, system integrators and product creators can specify these roles; and the evidence they might need to provide to support associated safety arguments.</p> <p>Use the menu on the left to navigate within the site, and the Table of contents on the right to browse within a page.
