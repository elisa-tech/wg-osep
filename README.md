# Open-Source Engineering Process (OSEP)

The ELISA Open-Source Engineering Process working group (OSEP) examines how
software engineering processes can be used to facilitate the certification of
safety-related systems incorporating Linux and other FOSS. We aim to consider
the roles that a Linux-based OS might have in such systems, and identify how
FOSS developers, system integrators and product creators can specify these, and
provide evidence to support associated safety arguments.

This repository captures the peer-reviewed outputs of the group; you will find
collaborative work-in-progress (topic suggestions, notes, etc) in the project
[wiki](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-osep/wiki).
