# ELISA Safety Study Framework

This document describes the motivation, objectives and underlying assumptions
for the Linux- and safety-related studies undertaken and published by the
ELISA project, and proposes

## Motivation

* Organisations seek guidance on achieving their safety goals and facilitating safety certification for systems that involve Linux

## Objectives

* To provide a framework for the specification and analysis of Linux-based
  systems in the context of a project employing safety-relevant applications
* To undertake and document safety and systems analysis and prototyping for specific functionality and safety-related use cases, to illustrate how this framework may be applied

## Framework Inputs

Organisations using the proposed framework must necessarily provide the
following inputs, as these are context-specific.

* Project definition
    - What is the purpose of the system using Linux and what role does Linux
      (or applications depending on Linux) play in that system?
* Project Context
    - System specification, including high-level system architecture
* Target standard for compliance
    - e.g. ISO 26262:2018
* Execution environment
    - Other system components or inputs that inform the execution environment
      for applications that depend on the Linux implementation
* Safety Concept
    â€“ Safety goals for the target system, and strategies or solutions to be
      provided by other processes, or components of the target system

For ELISA's illustrative examples, we will document our assumptions about these
inputs, to help organisations to understand how they may apply to their own
target context.
