#
# A system-level constraint specifies system conditions or behaviors that need
# to be satisfied to prevent hazards (and ultimately prevent losses)
#
# These constraints differ from controller constraints inasmuch as they
# describe how components in the system need to work together in order
# to prevent hazards.

Constraints:

- Identifier: SC-1
  Text: >
    If the kernel stops responding to external input, then such behavior must be 
    detected and measures taken to restore the system to its operational state.
  Hazards: [ H-1 ]

- Identifier: SC-2
  Text: >
    The integrity of the user space memory shall be maintained by the kernel.
    Hazards: [ H-2 ]

- Identifier: SC-3
  Text: >
    If the kernel data integrity is broken, such behavior must be detected 
    and measures taken to restore the system to its operational state.
  Hazards: [ H-3 ]

- Identifier: SC-4
  Text: >
    If the kernel violates its boundaries, such behavior must be detected 
    and measures taken to restore the system to its operational state.
  Hazards: [ H-4 ]
