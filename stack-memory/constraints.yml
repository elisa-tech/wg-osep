#
# A system-level constraint specifies system conditions or behaviors that need
# to be satisfied to prevent hazards (and ultimately prevent losses)
#
# These constraints differ from controller constraints inasmuch as they
# describe how components in the system need to work together in order
# to prevent hazards.

Constraints:

- Identifier: SC-1.1
  Text: >
    Coding practices that may result in the corruption of safety-critical data
    or program control structures stored in stack memory must be detected and
    remedied during software development
  Hazards: [ H-1 ]

- Identifier: SC-1.2
  Text: >
    Corruption of safety-critical data or program control structures stored in
    stack memory must be detected during software execution
  Hazards: [ H-1 ]

- Identifier: SC-2.1
  Text: >
    Critical operating system data or program control structures must not be
    stored adjacent to the memory allocated for the stack
  Hazards: [ H-2 ]

- Identifier: SC-3.1
  Text: >
    Safety-critical data and program control structures allocated on the stack
    must be initialised before use
  Hazards: [ H-3 ]
