#
# A system-level constraint specifies system conditions or behaviors that need
# to be satisfied to prevent hazards (and ultimately prevent losses)
#
# These constraints differ from controller constraints inasmuch as they
# describe how components in the system need to work together in order
# to prevent hazards.

Constraints:

- Identifier: SC-1.1
  Text: >
    Safety-critical data must be protected from stack overflow
  Hazards: [ H-1 ]

- Identifier: SC-1.1
  Text: >
    Corruption of safety-critical data by stack overflow must be detected
  Hazards: [ H-2 ]

- Identifier: SC-2.1
  Text: >
    Critical operating system data must be protected from stack depth overflow
  Hazards: [ H-2 ]
